# Customer Churn Prediction
In this personal project, I have applied machine learning models into predicting numbers of churned customers. The project follows steps from data collection, data cleaning, feature engineering, model training and testing, model evaluation, model tuning.

## ✅ Project Overview
In this personal project, I have handle a small dataset called 'Telco-Customer-Churn' to apply appropriate machine learning models into predicting numbers of churned customers in order to improve business risk from this group that could leads to revenue loss. The project used various models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost to train and test the dataset. Logistic Regression performed the best among 4 model due to the preference of the data features and data size. However, I believed with a bigger and non-linear feature dataset, LR is not as good as the others.
